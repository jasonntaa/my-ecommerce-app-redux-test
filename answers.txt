1. useState is best for simple, local state that only one component needs. A common example is toggling UI elements or tracking the value of a form input.

2. useReducer is preferred when state has multiple related fields or when the update logic becomes more complex. It helps centralize state transitions and keeps the code organized.

3. Prop drilling happens when props are passed through multiple components that do not actually use them, just so a deeply nested component can access the data. It is considered a problem because it clutters components and makes the data flow harder to maintain.

4. The main trade-off is that when a context value changes, all components consuming that context re-render, which can cause unnecessary performance overhead if the context holds frequently updated data.

5. 
createSlice requires three properties:
• name
• initialState
• reducers

6. Context API is the better choice because the user object is simple, changes infrequently, and needs to be accessible across a few components without complex state logic. Using Redux adds extra setup, boilerplate, and tooling that isn’t necessary for something this simple
